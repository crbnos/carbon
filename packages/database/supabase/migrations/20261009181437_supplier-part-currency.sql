-- Supplier part prices in the supplier's currency.
--
-- A supplier quotes in its own currency, so a supplier part's price is now
-- stored as quoted: "supplierUnitPrice" in "currencyCode", per PURCHASE unit
-- (the supplier's unit of measure). Readers convert it at the CURRENT exchange
-- rate when they use it — onto a purchase order or invoice in the document's
-- currency, or into base for quote costing — so the price never goes stale
-- against a rate snapshot.
--
-- Price breaks ("supplierPartPrice") are in their supplier part's currency.

-- 1. The price columns hold the supplier's currency now: rename, keep the data.
ALTER TABLE "supplierPart" RENAME COLUMN "unitPrice" TO "supplierUnitPrice";
ALTER TABLE "supplierPartPrice" RENAME COLUMN "unitPrice" TO "supplierUnitPrice";

-- 2. The currency the price is in. Nullable so a backup taken before this
--    column still restores; readers treat NULL as the company's base currency,
--    which is what every price written before this migration was.

--    (÷ conversionFactor), while the purchase order and invoice forms, planning
--    and update-purchased-prices all read and write it per purchase unit. The
--    two only disagree when conversionFactor is not 1.
--
--    Price breaks from those two writers carry their source, so they are
--    repaired exactly. The part's own price has no source; it was set to the
--    cheapest of those breaks, so a part whose price still equals one of its
--    Quote / Purchase Order breaks is repaired with them. A price that matches
--    none was last written per purchase unit and is left alone. Runs before
--    the break repair, which changes the values it compares against.
