-- Job completion receives exactly the completed quantity of a serial-tracked item.
--
-- Bug: for a serial-tracked made item, complete_job_to_inventory received one unit
-- per unconsumed job serial REGARDLESS of p_quantity_complete, and flipped every one
-- of them Available. Completing at 0 therefore put the unit in stock while
-- backflush_job_materials (prorated by the same quantity) consumed nothing, and
-- completing twice received the same serial twice.
--
-- Fix, serial branch only:
--   * receive exactly the newly completed units (p_quantity_complete minus what the
--     job already received), never a unit this job has already received;
--   * take units already finished on the shop floor (Available) first, then by
--     serial number; never a Consumed, Rejected or Scrapped unit;
--   * flip only the received units to Available;
--   * refuse the completion when fewer single-unit serials are left than the
--     units being completed, or when the cumulative quantity would drop below
--     what the job already received.
-- The job row is locked first so two concurrent completions cannot compute the
-- same receipt delta.
-- Refuse a fractional completion quantity for serial-tracked items.
-- And refuse a completion quantity <= 0 for stocked items: receiving nothing while
-- marking the job Completed is how the unit/material mismatch arose. Non-Inventory
-- (service) completions keep their existing behavior. The fully-scrapped branch of
-- sync_finish_job_operation never calls this function and is unaffected.
