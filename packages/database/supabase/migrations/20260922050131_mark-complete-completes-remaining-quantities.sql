-- "Mark as Complete" completes the remaining quantities, not just the status.
--
-- Bug: completing a job from the ERP dialog (or the MCP tool) set
-- job.status = 'Completed' and received the goods, but left every operation's
-- quantityComplete where it was. An operation is only Done once its reported
-- quantity reaches its target, so the routing stayed open and the job kept
-- reading In Progress behind a Completed status. Inventory and the backflush
-- were always correct; it is the operation-level record that was missing.
--
-- Fix: before the status flip, close each open terminal operation — set its
-- quantityComplete to the quantity being completed, and its status to Done.
-- Both are required: the auto-Done predicate lives in
-- sync_update_job_operation_quantities, which fires on productionQuantity
-- writes rather than on a jobOperation update, so a quantity-only write would
-- leave the routing open behind a Completed job.
--
-- No synthetic productionQuantity row is inserted. A desk completion is not
-- shop-floor production and must not fabricate operator-attributed history.
--
-- Closing an operation fires sync_finish_job_operation, which may complete the
-- job through the same path MES uses. That is harmless: the rest of this
-- function is then an idempotent re-completion, which it already supports — the
-- receipt delta is zero, so nothing is received or consumed twice.
--
-- Serial-tracked jobs are the exception. A serial unit is an individually
-- numbered trackedEntity and cannot be conjured here without bypassing
-- assign-serial-numbers, so a serial job with units still outstanding is
-- refused and the whole completion rolls back — never Completed on a serial
-- requirement that was not satisfied. A serial job already finished in MES has
-- no shortfall and completes normally.
--
-- complete_job_to_inventory is recreated VERBATIM from its newest committed
-- definition (20260916131445_merge-aware-job-receipt.sql); the ONLY change is
-- the PERFORM below, placed after the validation guards and before the status
-- UPDATE (the interceptor's roll-up skips an already-Completed job).

-- A job's OPEN terminal top-level operations: the ones that finish the job's
-- own product, with no further top-level operation depending on them.
--
-- The same predicate is already inlined in sync_finish_job_operation and
-- sync_update_job_operation_quantities; those keep their copies (forking them
-- is a separate change), but new callers share this definition rather than
-- adding a fourth.
